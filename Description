Cat vs Dog Classifier using Logistic Regression
Introduction:
This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a Logistic Regression model. The model is trained on a dataset of 6500 images each of cats and dogs, where pixel values serve as input features to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

üìÅ Dataset Source: Microsoft Cats vs Dogs Dataset on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset)

Model Preparation:
Dataset: The dataset consists of 6500 images of cats and 6500 images of dogs, resized to 64x64 pixels for consistent input.

Data Preprocessing: Images were converted into numerical arrays, flattened, and split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

Training the Model: A Logistic Regression model was trained using Scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on the test set.

Performance Metrics:
Accuracy: 51.80%

Key Insights:
The model performs almost equally for both classes with precision and recall values around 0.51‚Äì0.53.

The F1-score of 0.52 indicates balanced, though modest, classification ability.

Conclusion:
This basic Logistic Regression model demonstrates that while simple models can learn from image data, their performance is limited. Future improvements may include:
  * Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  * Applying data augmentation
  * Trying transfer learning with pre-trained models
